# AngularJS-Weather-App

 AngularJS-Weather-App is an app to show weather on geolocation position. You have also the possibility to show weather by providing country code or country town or Zip code.

# Description

AngularJS-Weather-App is a simple HTML/JS app preferably based on AngularJS v1 which, when you open the site, asks for a permission to read your current location, and then uses the http://openweathermap.org/current public API to fetch the weather for that location and displays it.
If the user denies to share the location, It shows a little input form for entering postcode or country, and display the weather based on that location.
